# Bayesian Joint Models, with Application to HIV Data

A project submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in the faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies (Department of Statistics).

In this project, we first give a brief review on models that are used for longitudinal and survival data analysis, and then we discuss some common approacheson evaluating the joint model with a focus on the Bayesian method. The R package `JMbayes` developed by Dr.Dimitris Rizopoulos at Erasmus University Rotterdamis employed to demonstrate an application of joint model using the HIV data.
